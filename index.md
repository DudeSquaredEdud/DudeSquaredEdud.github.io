## Introduction
Hi, I'm Ashton Andrepont[${^1}$](#1).

I like computers and pedagogy.

I want to help people learn using software.

## Backstory
I grew up in rural Louisiana, where the education system is rather in a crisis. We are often ranked the 50th in education quality (51st counting D.C.)[${^2}$](#2) After I switched from toiling through public school to learning at a magnet school, I was exposed to how a quality education can change someone's life.

It made me want to help people like me learn; kids in under-served communities struggling to satisfy their thirst for knowledge and desire to express their creativity.

It is a French name; the exact origin is disputed.

I was always told that it was the name of a horse thief -- his name was originally "Pierre Andre Pont," his middle and last name being fused in an attempt to thwart anyone from France trying to look for him after he fled to the United States.

[*Buuuuuuut* apparently there's a website that says that it's just a normal name from France.](https://namecensus.com/last-names/andrepont-surname-popularity/) It's wild.

When I was in grade school, my French teacher told us about this news article that said that Louisiana ranked 51st in education. He joked that someone from Louisiana must have wrote the article.

Jokes aside, it's bad here. Google anything about it to find out more.
