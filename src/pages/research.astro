		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>
			My research focuses on curriculum learning methodologies and AI-powered educational technology, 
			with particular emphasis on accessibility for students with learning difficulties. My work 
			combines computational approaches with real-world implementation, ensuring theoretical advances 
			translate into practical solutions that genuinely serve learners.

		<h2>Research Philosophy</h2>
		<p>
			I believe that computer science research should address pressing social challenges, particularly 
			in education. My work is motivated by the educational disparities I've witnessed and experienced 
			firsthand - from the failures of systems like Edgenuity to the transformative potential of 
			well-designed educational technology.
		</p>
		<p>
			My approach centers students with learning difficulties as primary users, applying an 
			"anti-Edgenuity" design philosophy where every decision prioritizes genuine learning over 
			administrative convenience. Each project combines rigorous computational methods with 
			accessibility-first design, ensuring solutions that benefit all learners.
