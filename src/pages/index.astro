		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>Undergraduate Research - Machine Learning</h3>
			<p>
				I worked on a project exploring curriculum learning approaches for image classification,
				investigating how the order of training examples affects neural network performance.
				This work introduced me to deep learning research methodologies and gave me hands-on
				experience with convolutional neural networks.

			<h3>Software Development - Educational Technology</h3>
			<p>
				I have gained experience developing educational software focused on accessibility,
				including work on note-taking applications and learning management systems. 
				This work sparked my interest in how technology can better serve diverse learners.

		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>Leadership & Project Management</h3>
			<p>
				I led a small team developing an educational application and served as president 
				of my high school's Computer Science Club. These experiences taught me project 
				coordination, team communication, and technical mentoring skills.

		<h2>Research Interests</h2>
		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>AI-Powered Accessibility Systems</h3>
			<p>
				Using machine learning to automatically adapt educational content for students with 
				learning difficulties and disabilities, moving beyond simple modifications to 
				fundamental cognitive restructuring that genuinely serves diverse learners.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>Human-AI Collaboration in Education</h3>
			<p>
				Exploring how AI can amplify human teaching capabilities rather than replacing them, 
				ensuring technology serves as a tool for empowerment rather than a replacement for 
				human connection and understanding.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>Cognitive Load Calibration</h3>
			<p>
				Creating AI systems that dynamically adjust complexity and pacing of educational 
				content based on individual cognitive capacity, preventing both under-challenge 
				and overwhelming experiences.
			</p>

		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>
			My work represents a natural evolution toward solving what I consider the most important 
			problem of our time: making high-quality education accessible, engaging, and effective 
			for every learner. Having experienced both the failures of poorly designed educational 
			technology and the transformative potential of well-designed systems, I understand how 
			technology can either bridge or widen existing educational gaps.
