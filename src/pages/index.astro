		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I am a computer science graduate and educational technology developer driven by a personal mission to create learning systems that serve students rather than frustrate them. My journey from being an "Edgenuity victim" to EdTech innovator shapes my approach to designing technology that genuinely supports human learning.</p>
		
		<p>Currently working as Lead Backend Developer for BeNakama, a London-based EdTech startup, I develop AI-powered classroom systems for UK high schools while pursuing graduate research opportunities in computational learning systems and human-AI collaboration.</p>
		
		<p>I completed my BS in Computer Science at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2.5 years, graduating magna cum laude with a 3.83 GPA and receiving the Distinctive Researcher designation. My research on curriculum learning for CNNs was presented at IBM Thomas J. Watson Laboratory (AICS'24).</p>

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>Research - Curriculum Learning for CNNs</h3>
			<p>
				Principal researcher investigating curriculum learning approaches for image classification CNNs. 
				Key finding: sorting images by wavelet entropy alone produced poor results, leading to exploration 
				of hybrid complexity measures. Research presented at IBM Thomas J. Watson Laboratory (AICS'24).

			<h3>Leadership & Project Management</h3>
			<p>
				I led a small team developing an educational application and served as president 
				of my high school's Computer Science Club. These experiences taught me project 
				coordination, team communication, and technical mentoring skills.

		<h2>Personal Mission</h2>
		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>From Edgenuity Victim to EdTech Innovator</h3>
			<p>
				My approach to educational technology is shaped by personal experience with systems like Edgenuity, 
				where broken answer detection made learning unnecessarily frustrating. This experience taught me that 
				educational technology fails when it prioritizes administrative convenience over human cognition.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having witnessed educational inequality from rural Louisiana classrooms to cutting-edge London EdTech 
				development, I'm committed to creating technology that bridges rather than widens educational disparities. 
				Every design decision in my work prioritizes genuine learning over compliance metrics.

		<h2>Research Interests</h2>
		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>AI-Powered Accessibility Systems</h3>
			<p>
				Using machine learning to automatically adapt educational content for students with 
				learning difficulties and disabilities, moving beyond simple modifications to 
				fundamental cognitive restructuring that genuinely serves diverse learners.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>Human-AI Collaboration in Education</h3>
			<p>
				Exploring how AI can amplify human teaching capabilities rather than replacing them, 
				ensuring technology serves as a tool for empowerment rather than a replacement for 
				human connection and understanding.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>Cognitive Load Calibration</h3>
			<p>
				Creating AI systems that dynamically adjust complexity and pacing of educational 
				content based on individual cognitive capacity, preventing both under-challenge 
				and overwhelming experiences.
			</p>

		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>
			My work represents a natural evolution toward solving what I consider the most important 
			problem of our time: making high-quality education accessible, engaging, and effective 
			for every learner. Having experienced both the failures of poorly designed educational 
			technology and the transformative potential of well-designed systems, I understand how 
			technology can either bridge or widen existing educational gaps.
