		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I am a computer science graduate with research experience in machine learning and educational technology. My work focuses on developing accessible educational platforms and exploring AI applications in learning environments.</p>
		
		<p>I am interested in pursuing research in computational learning systems, particularly at the intersection of human-computer interaction and cognitive science.</p>
		
		<p>I completed my BS in Computer Science at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, graduating magna cum laude with a 3.83 GPA in an accelerated program. My academic focus included artificial intelligence, educational technology, and accessibility-focused system design.</p>

		<h2>Research & Professional Experience</h2>
		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>AI Researcher - ULL Data Analysis and Deep Learning Lab</h3>
			<p>
				I applied curriculum learning techniques to image classification convolutional neural networks,
				focusing on training optimization through complexity-based data ordering. I presented this
				research at IBM Thomas J. Watson Laboratory (AICS'24), demonstrating improvements in
				model convergence and accuracy through structured learning approaches.

			<h3>Lead Backend Developer - BeNakama (London)</h3>
			<p>
				I led development of classroom systems and the educational video game Ascend 
				for UK high school students. I designed an AI-powered student question system 
				that matches content to individual academic ability levels, with particular 
				focus on accessibility for students with learning difficulties and disabilities.

			<h3>Tech Lead - Aluminotes</h3>
			<p>
				I led a 3-person development team to create an AI-leveraging note-taking app for students 
				with disabilities. Our project won 1st place in the Inn-eaux-vate pitch competition. 
				I handled full-stack development with Django, JavaScript, and Python, prioritizing 
				accessibility-first design principles.

		<h2>Research Interests</h2>
		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>AI-Powered Accessibility Systems</h3>
			<p>
				Using machine learning to automatically adapt educational content for students with 
				learning difficulties and disabilities, moving beyond simple modifications to 
				fundamental cognitive restructuring that genuinely serves diverse learners.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>Human-AI Collaboration in Education</h3>
			<p>
				Exploring how AI can amplify human teaching capabilities rather than replacing them, 
				ensuring technology serves as a tool for empowerment rather than a replacement for 
				human connection and understanding.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>Cognitive Load Calibration</h3>
			<p>
				Creating AI systems that dynamically adjust complexity and pacing of educational 
				content based on individual cognitive capacity, preventing both under-challenge 
				and overwhelming experiences.
			</p>

		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>
			My work represents a natural evolution toward solving what I consider the most important 
			problem of our time: making high-quality education accessible, engaging, and effective 
			for every learner. Having experienced both the failures of poorly designed educational 
			technology and the transformative potential of well-designed systems, I understand how 
			technology can either bridge or widen existing educational gaps.
