		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			I am a computational researcher driven by the belief that understanding how humans learn 
			is the key to designing educational technologies that fundamentally transform learning outcomes. 
			My journey from computer science to educational technology began with experiencing firsthand 
			how educational technology can fail learners - and my mission to build better systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			As an AI Researcher at ULL's Deep Learning Lab and Lead Backend Developer at BeNakama 
			(London-based EdTech startup), I combine rigorous research with real-world implementation 
			to create educational technology that serves learners rather than breaking them.

		<h2>Research Interests</h2>
		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>AI-Powered Accessibility Systems</h3>
			<p>
				Using machine learning to automatically adapt educational content for students with 
				learning difficulties and disabilities, moving beyond simple modifications to 
				fundamental cognitive restructuring that genuinely serves diverse learners.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>Human-AI Collaboration in Education</h3>
			<p>
				Exploring how AI can amplify human teaching capabilities rather than replacing them, 
				ensuring technology serves as a tool for empowerment rather than a replacement for 
				human connection and understanding.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="research-item">
			<h3>Cognitive Load Calibration</h3>
			<p>
				Creating AI systems that dynamically adjust complexity and pacing of educational 
				content based on individual cognitive capacity, preventing both under-challenge 
				and overwhelming experiences.
			</p>

		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>
			My work represents a natural evolution toward solving what I consider the most important 
			problem of our time: making high-quality education accessible, engaging, and effective 
			for every learner. Having experienced both the failures of poorly designed educational 
			technology and the transformative potential of well-designed systems, I understand how 
			technology can either bridge or widen existing educational gaps.
