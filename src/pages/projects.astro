		<h2>Research Contributions</h2>
		<div class="project-item">
			<h3>Wavelet Entropy Analysis for Curriculum Learning</h3>
			<p>
				Discovered that sorting images by wavelet entropy alone produces poor results for 
				curriculum learning, leading to deeper investigation into multi-factor complexity 
				measures. Research contributes important negative results to curriculum learning field.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Published findings challenge existing assumptions about complexity measures</p>

		<h2>Philosophy & Approach</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Anti-Edgenuity Design Philosophy:</strong> Every project decision is evaluated against 
			"would this frustrate learners like traditional EdTech does?" This approach, born from personal 
			experience with failing educational technology, ensures that systems serve learners rather than 
			breaking them.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Accessibility-First Innovation:</strong> Designing primarily for students with learning 
			difficulties and disabilities consistently leads to better solutions for all learners. This 
			principle drives both technical architecture and user experience design across all projects.
