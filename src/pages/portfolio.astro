const introduction = "I still remember Gamal Abdel Nasser's rise and fall as vividly as a film - not because I'm a history fan, but because of how I learned it. In fall 2021 at LSMSA, Dr. Kyle Stephens taught the modern Middle East as a line of vivid stories where historical figures were drawn out as very real people who had desires and fears, where locations became stages for their defining acts. It was much more similar to watching a play unfold in front of me than any lecture I had seen before. That class taught me what 13 years of Louisiana public school couldn't: learners can rise to any challenge if they enjoy the process.

Once I saw what learning could be, I couldn't unsee what was missing everywhere else. With my CS background, I knew I could create something that could scale these experiences beyond elite magnet schools and into anyone's hands.

I started with Aluminotes, using LLMs to transform hastily-typed notes into structured lecture materials - born from me and my friends' ADHD making traditional note-taking nearly impossible. We used it for a class project, and even won first place at a pitch competition with it, so we were very happy with the results.

I joined my college's ML research laboratory to learn more about AI, as I knew I would be using it later on to personalize education. My research focused on curriculum learning and experimental training methods for convolutional models - work that led to presenting at AICS at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Laboratory.

Now, as fullstack engineer and researcher at BeNakama, I work on Ascend, a math-based RPG that adapts difficulty to student skill - directly implementing a program that tests students at their abilities while keeping them engaged. This is also the most direct application of my research - I am involved with design and implementation of the systems that the students use.

I'm pursuing research to understand the cognitive and technological foundations of effective learning, and find out how to apply that to allow everyone access to it. My goal is to make Dr. Stephens' classroom the norm, not the exception - so every student can experience what it feels like to genuinely love learning.";
