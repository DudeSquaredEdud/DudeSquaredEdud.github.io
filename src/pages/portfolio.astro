const background = `I still remember Gamal Abdel Nasser's rise and fall as vividly as a film - not because I'm a history fan, but because of how I learned it. In fall 2021 at LSMSA, Dr. Kyle Stephens taught the modern Middle East as a line of vivid stories where historical figures were drawn out as very real people with desires and fears. It was like watching a play unfold, not sitting through a lecture.

That being said. It was absolutely the most difficult class I had ever taken. But it taught me something 13 years of Louisiana public school couldn't: when you enjoy the learning process, you can learn anything.

Once I saw what learning could be, I couldn't unsee what was missing everywhere else. The problem wasn't that students were lazy or incapable - it was that most education environments kill enjoyment. If I could figure out how to make a system where education was more engaging, I could change everything.

That insight has driven everything I've built since. I start with a problem I or someone I know actually experiences. I build a system that recognizes what's going wrong. Then I design it to respond in a way that matters.

With Aluminotes, I recognized that ADHD brains process information faster but with less clarity - and built a tool that responds by reformatting their notes. With my research on curriculum learning, I learned to recognize what neural networks struggle with - and ran experiments with metrics to learn what makes certain images complex. With Ascend, I recognized that students disengage when math feels impossibly hard or boringly easy - and built a system that adapts in real-time.

My goal is to make the engagement of Dr. Stephens' classroom the norm, not the exception. To build systems that recognize struggle and respond with the kind of care that actually helps people learn.`;

const projectIntroduction = `I build systems that recognize and respond to the user. Because I know the magic of education isn't just knowledge transfer - it's when the system sees what's needed and adjusts. 

These projects show three different angles on that: helping ADHD students take notes and account for potential gaps, learning systems that adapt to the student's skill level, and research in understanding what makes information difficult in other systems. 

They all come from the same belief: good systems pay attention.`
