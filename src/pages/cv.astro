		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<p>
			My journey from being an "Edgenuity victim" to EdTech innovator drives my commitment to creating 
			educational technology that serves learners rather than frustrates them. Having experienced 
			educational inequality from rural Louisiana classrooms to cutting-edge London EdTech development, 
			I understand how technology can either bridge or widen educational disparities.
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe that understanding how humans learn is the key to designing technologies that 
			fundamentally transform learning outcomes. My work prioritizes genuine learning over compliance 
			metrics, with every design decision centered on accessibility for students with learning 
			difficulties and disabilities. When we design for the margins, we create better solutions for everyone.
