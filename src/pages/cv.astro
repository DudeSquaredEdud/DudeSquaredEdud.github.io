		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<p>
			Driven by the belief that understanding how humans learn is the key to designing educational 
			technologies that fundamentally transform learning outcomes. My work focuses on creating 
			technology that serves learners rather than breaking them, with particular emphasis on 
			accessibility for students with learning difficulties and disabilities.
