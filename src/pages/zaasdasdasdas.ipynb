    "# Portfolio Page Development - October 22, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Objective\n",
    "Create a new portfolio page with basic outlines for three projects:\n",
    "1. **Aluminotes** - AI-powered note-taking app for students with disabilities\n",
    "2. **BeNakama** - Educational technology for UK schools\n",
    "3. **Wavelet Analysis Research** - CNN curriculum learning research\n",
    "\n",
    "## Session Strategy\n",
    "1. **Research existing content** - Gather project information from workspace files\n",
    "2. **Understand site structure** - Check how portfolio content is organized\n",
    "3. **Create basic outlines** - Write minimal but effective project descriptions\n",
    "4. **Add to existing portfolio** - Integrate with current site architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Investigation & Decisions\n",
    "| Issue | Root Cause | Solution | Quality Check |\n",
    "|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|\n",
    "| Need project info | User wants basic outlines only | Extract key details from existing files | Verify against content audit |\n",
    "| Site structure unclear | Multiple portfolio systems exist | Use existing content collections | Check portfolio.astro integration |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Reuse Log\n",
    "- **Found & Used**: Existing portfolio structure in /src/content/portfolio/\n",
    "- **Found & Used**: Existing projectDetails structure in /src/content/projectDetails/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Progress Checkpoints\n",
    "- [x] Research complete - found existing project information\n",
    "- [ ] Basic outlines created\n",
    "- [ ] Content added to site structure\n",
    "- [ ] Portfolio page updated\n",
    "- [ ] Verification complete\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "- Aluminotes already has detailed content in /src/content/portfolio/aluminotes.md and /src/content/projectDetails/aluminotes.md\n",
    "- Wavelet research detailed in /src/content/portfolio/dadl-research.md and /src/content/projectDetails/dadl-research.md\n",
    "- BeNakama content exists in /src/content/projectDetails/benakama.md but missing from portfolio collection\n",
    "- Research content available in /future_planning/My_research/main.tex"

    "## Content Assessment Complete\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… **GOOD NEWS**: All three projects already have portfolio content!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Existing Files Found:**\n",
    "1. **Aluminotes**: `/src/content/portfolio/aluminotes.md` - Complete with competition win details\n",
    "2. **BeNakama**: `/src/content/portfolio/benakama.md` - Basic outline already exists\n",
    "3. **Wavelet Research**: `/src/content/portfolio/dadl-research.md` - Full research description with IBM presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Status Analysis:**\n",
    "- All projects have basic portfolio entries âœ…\n",
    "- All projects have detailed project pages in `projectDetails/` âœ…\n",
    "- Content follows proper Astro frontmatter format âœ…\n",
    "- Images specified but need to verify they exist\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. Verify the portfolio page is properly displaying these projects\n",
    "2. Check if images exist or need placeholder images\n",
    "3. Potentially enhance the BeNakama entry to match user's request for \"basic possible outline\""

    "\n",
    "**Request**: \"most basic possible outline\" for the three projects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Content Assessment:**\n",
    "1. **Aluminotes** - Currently has detailed description with multiple sections (might be too detailed)\n",
    "2. **BeNakama** - Already fairly basic/minimal âœ… \n",
    "3. **Wavelet Research** - Currently detailed with multiple paragraphs (might be too detailed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**: \n",
    "The existing content might be more detailed than the \"most basic possible outline\" requested. User wants minimal outlines, so I should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep BeNakama as-is (already basic)\n",
    "2. Create simplified versions of Aluminotes and Wavelet Research if current ones are too detailed\n",
    "3. Or verify with user if current level is acceptable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Content Level**: Professional portfolio level\n",
    "**Requested Level**: \"Most basic possible outline\"\n",
    "\n",
