## AI-Leveraging Accessibility Technology for Educational Equity

Aluminotes represents my commitment to accessibility-first educational technology design. As Tech Lead of a 3-person development team, I led the creation of an AI-leveraging note-taking app specifically designed for students with disabilities, ultimately winning 1st place in the Inn-eaux-vate pitch competition and validating the market need for genuinely accessible educational technology.

### Technical Leadership & Innovation

Full-Stack Development Leadership:
- Backend Architecture: Django framework implementation for scalable educational applications
- Frontend Development: HTML, JavaScript interface design prioritizing cognitive accessibility
- AI Integration: Python-based AI systems for intelligent text processing and reformatting
- Team Coordination: Led 3-person development team through complex technical challenges

AI-Powered Accessibility Features:
- Intelligent text reformatting and rewording to assist students with learning differences
- AI-driven content adaptation based on individual cognitive accessibility needs
- Automated processing that reduces cognitive load while preserving educational content integrity
- Accessibility-first design philosophy: when technology works for the most vulnerable learners, it works better for everyone

### Team Leadership Breakthrough

Coordination Challenge Overcome: Initially faced significant code conflicts within the development team that threatened project success. Through implementing intensive communication protocols, we not only resolved the immediate technical issues but developed coordination systems so efficient they seemed unnecessary - ultimately saving significant development time and preventing future bottlenecks.

Leadership Learning: This experience demonstrated that technical challenges are often secondary to team dynamics in successful project delivery. The communication frameworks we developed became a model for effective remote technical collaboration.

### Anti-Edgenuity Design Philosophy

Mission-Driven Development: Every design decision was tested against the question "does this genuinely help students with learning difficulties?" This approach explicitly rejected the compliance-focused design that characterizes failed educational technology like Edgenuity, which prioritizes administrative convenience over genuine learning support.

Accessibility as Innovation Driver: Rather than treating accessibility as an afterthought, Aluminotes centered students with disabilities as primary users. This approach led to breakthrough innovations that benefit all learners - proving that designing for the margins creates universally better solutions.

### Competitive Validation & Market Impact

1st Place Inn-eaux-vate Victory: The competition win validated that our technical solutions address real market needs, not just interesting research questions. The success demonstrated both the technical quality of our implementation and the urgent need for genuinely accessible educational technology.

Educational Technology Gap Addressed: Aluminotes fills a critical gap in the educational technology landscape by providing AI-powered accessibility tools that support rather than frustrate students with learning differences.

### Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Leadership: Successfully led technical team through complex development challenges
- Full-Stack Expertise: Django, HTML, JavaScript, Python for educational applications
- AI Integration: Practical application of AI systems for accessibility enhancement
- User-Centered Design: Accessibility-first approach resulting in universally beneficial solutions
- Project Management: Coordinated development timeline to successful competition delivery

### Connection to Graduate Research Vision

This project established my foundation for graduate research in AI-powered educational accessibility. The experience of translating accessibility needs into technical solutions, combined with the validation of competitive success, reinforced my commitment to developing educational technology that genuinely serves learners rather than administrative systems.

Future Research Direction: Aluminotes represents the practical application of my broader research vision - using AI to amplify human learning capabilities while respecting cognitive diversity and avoiding the rigid, frustrating experiences that characterize failed educational technology implementations.
