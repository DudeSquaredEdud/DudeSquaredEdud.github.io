## International EdTech Leadership: AI-Powered Educational Systems for UK Schools

As Lead Backend Developer for BeNakama, a London-based EdTech startup, I lead the development of advanced classroom systems and the educational video game Ascend, serving UK high school students. This role represents the intersection of my technical expertise, international collaboration skills, and commitment to educational technology that genuinely serves learners rather than administrative systems.

### AI-Powered Educational Innovation

Intelligent Student Assessment System:
- Designing and implementing AI-powered student question system that enables best-fit matching for student academic ability
- Currently in active development: AI systems specifically focused on empowering students with learning difficulties and disabilities
- Advanced backend architecture supporting real-time AI-powered educational interventions
- Secure classroom systems designed for international deployment across UK educational institutions

Technical Architecture Leadership:
- Unique technical responsibility: Only team member with computer science expertise, requiring multidisciplinary leadership across backend systems, AI research, and educational game development
- Full-stack coordination: React frontend with Mantine UI, Django backend architecture, Python AI integration
- International deployment management: Remote leadership from Louisiana to UK high school environments
- Educational game development: Leading technical aspects of "Ascend" gamified learning platform

### International Development Leadership

Cross-Cultural Technical Collaboration:
- Managing complex international development coordination across time zones and cultural contexts
- Bridging Louisiana computational expertise with London educational innovation requirements
- Remote leadership demonstrating ability to maintain high technical standards across international teams
- Direct impact on UK students through accessibility-focused educational technology deployment

Multidisciplinary Technical Skills:
- Backend Architecture: Secure, scalable classroom systems for international educational deployment
- AI System Research: Development of machine learning algorithms for educational assessment and intervention
- Game Development: Pixel art animation and educational game mechanics for student engagement
- Project Management: International team coordination and technical milestone delivery

### Anti-Edgenuity Mission Integration

Mission-Driven Technical Decision Making:
- Every design decision explicitly tested against "does this genuinely support learning or does it create administrative convenience?"
- Anti-Edgenuity philosophy: Rejecting the compliance-focused design that makes learning unnecessarily difficult and frustrating
- Prioritizing genuine learning outcomes over metrics that look good to administrators but fail students
- Accessibility-first approach ensuring technology works for students with learning difficulties

Educational Technology Innovation:
- Developing AI systems that adapt to individual learning needs rather than forcing students to adapt to technological limitations
- Focus on empowering rather than replacing human teaching capabilities
- International perspective on educational equity combining Louisiana and UK educational contexts

### Professional Growth & Leadership Development

Technical Leadership Expansion:
- Evolved from individual contributor to technical leader managing international educational technology deployment
- Developed expertise in educational AI systems, international team coordination, and scalable backend architecture
- Experience balancing multiple technical domains: AI research, backend systems, educational game development, international deployment

Educational Impact Measurement:
- Direct involvement in systems serving UK high school students across multiple institutions
- Real-world validation of AI-powered educational technology in active classroom environments
- International experience providing perspective on educational technology effectiveness across different cultural contexts

### Connection to Graduate Research Vision

Research-to-Practice Pipeline: BeNakama represents the practical application of my research interests in AI-powered educational systems. The experience of developing educational technology for international deployment, combined with my background in curriculum learning research, provides unique insight into what actually scales versus what remains academic theory.

Future Research Integration: This professional experience directly informs my graduate research interests in computational learning systems, particularly exploring how AI can amplify human teaching capabilities while avoiding the compliance-focused design failures that characterize traditional educational technology.

The role demonstrates my ability to translate theoretical understanding of learning systems into scalable technological solutions that serve diverse student populations across international educational contexts.
