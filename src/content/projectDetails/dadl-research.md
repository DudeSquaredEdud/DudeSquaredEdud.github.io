## Deep Learning Research: Curriculum Learning for Image Classification

As principal researcher at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's Data Analysis and Deep Learning Lab, I conducted independent research investigating how the complexity and ordering of training examples affects CNN learning performance. This work represents my introduction to rigorous academic research methodology and contributed to my growing understanding of the intersection between machine learning and human learning processes.

### Research Discovery & Methodology

Key Finding: My research discovered that sorting images by wavelet entropy alone produced poor curriculum learning results, leading to a deeper investigation into multi-factor complexity assessment approaches. This negative result proved valuable in advancing understanding of curriculum learning limitations and opened new research directions.

Technical Implementation:
- Advanced wavelet decomposition techniques for image complexity analysis
- Custom CNN architecture development and training pipeline optimization
- Statistical analysis and experimental validation of curriculum learning approaches
- Python-based deep learning implementation with rigorous experimental controls

### IBM Research Presentation

Academic Recognition: Presented research findings at IBM Thomas J. Watson Laboratory during AICS'24, demonstrating the caliber of research recognized by industry leaders. This presentation experience provided valuable exposure to academic communication standards and peer review processes.

Research Impact: The presentation validated both the quality of undergraduate research contributions and the importance of documenting negative results in advancing computational learning research.

### Connection to Human Learning

This research sparked my broader interest in how machine learning patterns might inform educational technology design. The experience of investigating why certain complexity measures fail in curriculum learning deepened my understanding of learning as a complex system that can be modeled, measured, and optimized - but never at the expense of human cognitive diversity.

Future Research Direction: This work established my foundation for graduate research in AI-powered learning systems, particularly exploring how computational approaches to curriculum design might translate into more effective educational technology for diverse learners.
