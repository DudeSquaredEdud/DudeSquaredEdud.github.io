# Educational Technology Development Project

## Project Overview

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on developing educational software with a particular focus on accessibility and inclusive design. This project allowed me to explore how technology can better serve students with diverse learning needs.

## Development Experience

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend Development**: Created user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Backend Systems**: Implemented server-side functionality using Python and Django
- **Database Design**: Structured data storage for user profiles and learning content
- **Accessibility Features**: Incorporated assistive technology support and inclusive design principles

### Design Philosophy
The project emphasized accessibility-first design, meaning we considered students with learning differences as primary users rather than an afterthought. This approach led to solutions that benefited all users.

## Skills Developed

Through this project, I gained experience in:

- **Full-Stack Development**: End-to-end application development and deployment
- **User-Centered Design**: Understanding user needs and designing appropriate solutions
- **Team Collaboration**: Working effectively in a small development team
- **Project Management**: Coordinating tasks, timelines, and deliverables

## Learning Outcomes

This project deepened my understanding of how technology can support education and reinforced my interest in developing tools that make learning more accessible to everyone. It also gave me practical experience in software development while working toward a meaningful social impact.

## Future Applications

The experience gained from this project has informed my interest in pursuing graduate research in educational technology and human-computer interaction, particularly exploring how AI and machine learning can create more personalized and accessible learning experiences.

## Research Questions

1. **Cognitive Restructuring**: How can AI systems move beyond text resizing to fundamental reorganization of information architecture for different cognitive processing styles?

2. **Real-time Adaptation**: What are the optimal methods for detecting cognitive load and learning difficulty patterns in real-time educational interactions?

3. **Universal Design Benefits**: How does designing primarily for students with learning difficulties create better systems for all learners?

4. **Cross-Cultural Implementation**: How do accessibility needs vary across different educational contexts (UK vs. US vs. international)?

## Technical Methodology

### AI System Architecture
- **Backend**: Secure classroom systems with international deployment capability
- **Frontend**: React, Mantine UI for accessible interface design
- **AI Components**: Custom algorithms for cognitive load detection and content adaptation
- **Accessibility Framework**: WCAG 2.1 AA+ compliance with enhanced cognitive accessibility features

### Research Validation
- **Real-world Testing**: Active deployment in UK high school environments
- **Competitive Validation**: 1st place pitch competition win
- **International Scale**: Remote leadership of international development team
- **Iterative Development**: Continuous feedback from students with learning difficulties

## Philosophical Approach

**Anti-Compliance Mindset**: Rejecting systems that prioritize administrative convenience over genuine learning support. Every design decision tested against "does this genuinely help students with learning difficulties?"

**Accessibility as Innovation**: Treating accessibility not as an afterthought but as the primary design driver that leads to breakthrough innovations in educational technology.

## Future Directions

1. **Scalability Research**: How to maintain personalized accessibility at scale across diverse educational contexts
2. **Cognitive Science Integration**: Incorporating latest research in learning differences and cognitive processing
3. **Teacher Training Systems**: Developing AI tools that help teachers understand and support diverse cognitive needs
4. **Policy Impact**: Translating research insights into educational technology policy recommendations

This research represents the intersection of rigorous AI research with real-world implementation, ensuring that advances in educational accessibility translate into measurable improvements for the students who need them most.
