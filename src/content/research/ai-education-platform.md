# Undergraduate Research in Machine Learning

## Project Overview

As an undergraduate student, I had the opportunity to work on a research project investigating curriculum learning approaches for training neural networks on image classification tasks. This experience introduced me to machine learning research methodologies and gave me hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks.

## Research Focus

The project explored how the order and structure of training examples can affect neural network learning performance. Rather than training on randomly ordered data, we investigated whether presenting examples in a structured progression from simple to complex could improve learning outcomes.

## Skills Developed

Through this research experience, I gained:

- **Technical Skills**: Experience with Python, deep learning frameworks, and data analysis tools
- **Research Methods**: Understanding of experimental design, hypothesis testing, and result interpretation  
- **Problem Solving**: Approach to debugging complex machine learning systems and analyzing unexpected results
- **Academic Communication**: Practice presenting technical concepts and research findings

## Learning Outcomes

This research experience helped me understand the iterative nature of machine learning research and the importance of careful experimental design. It reinforced my interest in pursuing graduate study in computational learning systems.

## Future Directions

This undergraduate research experience has motivated me to pursue more advanced study in machine learning and human-computer interaction, particularly exploring how AI systems can better support human learning and education.
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple image classification benchmarks

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch/TensorFlow for CNN implementation
- **Signal Processing**: Advanced wavelet decomposition techniques
- **Statistical Analysis**: Experimental design and hypothesis testing
- **Research Documentation**: Comprehensive results tracking and analysis

### Research Contributions
1. **Complexity Measure Innovation**: Novel approaches to measuring image complexity for curriculum design
2. **Negative Results Documentation**: Important findings about limitations of single-factor sorting methods
3. **Methodology Development**: Rigorous experimental protocols for curriculum learning research

## Academic Impact

**Conference Presentation**: Presented research findings at IBM Thomas J. Watson Laboratory during the AICS'24 conference, demonstrating the caliber of research recognized by industry leaders.

**Research Insights**: The discovery that simple complexity measures like wavelet entropy alone are insufficient for effective curriculum learning opened new research directions into multi-modal complexity assessment.

## Future Directions

This research established the foundation for more sophisticated curriculum learning approaches, highlighting the need for:
- Multi-factor complexity measures
- Adaptive curriculum strategies
- Domain-specific curriculum design principles

The work demonstrates both technical rigor and the kind of critical thinking that leads to breakthrough insights through careful investigation of negative results.
