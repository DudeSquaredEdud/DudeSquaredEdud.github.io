# Curriculum Learning for Image Classification CNNs

## Abstract

This research project investigated the application of curriculum learning methodologies to improve training efficiency and performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. The study explored various complexity measures, with particular focus on wavelet entropy-based sorting methods, to develop effective curriculum strategies.

## Research Context

At the ULL Data Analysis and Deep Learning Lab, I served as principal researcher examining how curriculum learning - the practice of training machine learning models by gradually introducing examples from easy to difficult - can be optimized for computer vision tasks.

## Key Findings

### Wavelet Entropy Investigation
- **Initial Hypothesis**: Sorting training images by wavelet entropy would provide an effective complexity measure for curriculum learning
- **Discovery**: Wavelet entropy alone produced poor results, leading to deeper investigation into multi-factor complexity measures
- **Innovation**: Developed hybrid approaches combining multiple complexity indicators for more robust curriculum design

### Methodology
- **Wavelet Decomposition**: Implemented advanced wavelet theory for feature extraction and complexity analysis
- **Experimental Design**: Rigorous statistical modeling and controlled experiments comparing curriculum vs. random training
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple image classification benchmarks

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch/TensorFlow for CNN implementation
- **Signal Processing**: Advanced wavelet decomposition techniques
- **Statistical Analysis**: Experimental design and hypothesis testing
- **Research Documentation**: Comprehensive results tracking and analysis

### Research Contributions
1. **Complexity Measure Innovation**: Novel approaches to measuring image complexity for curriculum design
2. **Negative Results Documentation**: Important findings about limitations of single-factor sorting methods
3. **Methodology Development**: Rigorous experimental protocols for curriculum learning research

## Academic Impact

**Conference Presentation**: Presented research findings at IBM Thomas J. Watson Laboratory during the AICS'24 conference, demonstrating the caliber of research recognized by industry leaders.

**Research Insights**: The discovery that simple complexity measures like wavelet entropy alone are insufficient for effective curriculum learning opened new research directions into multi-modal complexity assessment.

## Future Directions

This research established the foundation for more sophisticated curriculum learning approaches, highlighting the need for:
- Multi-factor complexity measures
- Adaptive curriculum strategies
- Domain-specific curriculum design principles

The work demonstrates both technical rigor and the kind of critical thinking that leads to breakthrough insights through careful investigation of negative results.
