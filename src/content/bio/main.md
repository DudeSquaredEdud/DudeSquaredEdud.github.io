Hi! I'm a backend engineer at BeNakama that's researching EdTech. I human-computer interaction is the crux of my work, and I'm heavily interested in the ways computers can help enhance ourselves humans.

I'm from Louisiana. The schools don't get much help here. Classes were too crowded for any teacher to specialize their content, so they always went with overly simplified lectures. This ended up putting everyone behind.

I had to supplement classes with online lessons to feel satisfied with what I was learning. But when my own school tried doing something similar, their education tools of choice were actively harmful to our ability to learn. Ever since then, I had a desire to make something better than that.

I wanted to make tools that take into account the uniqueness of students, and works with their abilities to create a learning environment that actively helps them grow.

And right now, I'm living that dream! Under my umbrella of tasks, I research, design, and create systems that help students feel accounted for and in control of their learning. As well as try to make such a grand task a little bit more fun than solving random homework questions.

My biggest hope is that my work is able to help every student - to help them go from feeling trapped against the systems they are into being able to grow in their environment, and wear that fact with pride.
