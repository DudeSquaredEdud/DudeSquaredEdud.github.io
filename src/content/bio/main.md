I'm a fullstack engineer researching and developing technology for education. My passion lies in how technology can support genuine personal growth, with an interest in psychological impacts such as self-image, real versus perceived progress, humanâ€“computer relationships, and evolving motivations.

<b>Short Personal Background:</b>
<br>
I'm from Louisiana, where I experienced the challenges of a struggling education system firsthand. To address teacher shortages, my school introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgenuity#Reception">a website</a>  that ultimately left me frustrated and disengaged. 
<br>
<br>
This inspired me to dedicate my career to building better learning tools. After college, I started working at <a href="https://benakama.com/">BeNakama</a>, where I develop and research tools that help people learn effectively while enjoying the process.
