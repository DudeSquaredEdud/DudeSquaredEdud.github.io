# About

Lifelong learner and software engineer, passionate about creating educational systems that empower underserved communities.

My experiences with the educational limitations in my home state of Louisiana inspired me to develop learning platforms that prioritize genuine understanding over opaque measures of performance. I focus on creating adaptive systems that meet learners where they are and guide them to their goals.

I am the Lead Backend Developer and Methodology Researcher at [BeNakama](https://benakama.com/), where I design scalable learning infrastructures that make quality education accessible. My work combines technical expertise with pedagogical research to create transformative educational experiences.

I hold a BS in Computer Science from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, graduating magna cum laude with Distinctive Researcher designation. My research on curriculum learning for CNNs was presented at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Laboratory (AICS'24). Currently exploring innovative approaches to AI education.

# Experience

## Lead Backend Developer - BeNakama (London)
**AI Systems • EdTech • Backend Development**

Developing AI-powered educational systems for UK high schools, including secure classroom platform and "Ascend" gamified learning tool. 

Leading AI student question system development with focus on accessibility for students with learning difficulties. 

Remote work from Louisiana since February 2025.

## Research - Curriculum Learning for CNNs
**Machine Learning • CNN • Academic Research**

Principal researcher investigating curriculum learning approaches for image classification CNNs. 

Key finding: sorting images by wavelet entropy alone produced poor results, leading to exploration of hybrid complexity measures. 

Research presented at IBM Thomas J. Watson Laboratory (AICS'24).

## Tech Lead - Aluminotes (Award-Winning)
**Team Leadership • Accessibility • Competition Winner**

Led 3-person development team creating AI-leveraging note-taking app for students with disabilities. 

Won 1st place in Inn-eaux-vate pitch competition. Full-stack development using Django, HTML, JavaScript, and Python with focus on accessibility-first design principles.

## Leadership & Project Management
**Team Leadership • Project Management • Mentoring**

I led a small team developing an educational application and served as president of my high school's Computer Science Club. 

These experiences taught me project coordination, team communication, and technical mentoring skills.

# Personal Mission

## From Edgenuity Victim to EdTech Innovator

My approach to educational technology is shaped by personal experience with systems like Edgenuity, where broken answer detection made learning unnecessarily frustrating. 

This experience taught me that educational technology fails when it prioritizes administrative convenience over human cognition.

Having witnessed educational inequality from rural Louisiana classrooms to cutting-edge London EdTech development, I'm committed to creating technology that bridges rather than widens educational disparities. 

Every design decision in my work prioritizes genuine learning over compliance metrics.

# Research Interests

## Cognitive Load Calibration

Creating AI systems that dynamically adjust complexity and pacing of educational content based on individual cognitive capacity, preventing both under-challenge and overwhelming experiences.

## AI-Powered Accessibility Systems

Using machine learning to automatically adapt educational content for students with learning difficulties and disabilities, moving beyond simple modifications to fundamental cognitive restructuring that genuinely serves diverse learners.

## Human-AI Collaboration in Education

Exploring how AI can amplify human teaching capabilities rather than replacing them, ensuring technology serves as a tool for empowerment rather than a replacement for human connection and understanding.

# Mission

My work revolves around solving what I consider to be the most important problem of our time: making high-quality education accessible, engaging, and effective for _every_ student.

Having experienced the failures of poorly designed educational technology and the transformative potential of a well-designed education system, I understand how technology can either widen educational gaps, or be the driving force to bridging them.
