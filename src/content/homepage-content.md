# About

Software engineer with a focus on educational technology and accessibility.

My experiences with educational technology in Louisiana inspired me to work on systems that actually help students learn. I believe technology should make learning more accessible, not more frustrating.

I currently work as a backend developer at BeNakama, a London-based EdTech startup, developing educational systems for UK schools while working remotely from Louisiana.

I hold a BS in Computer Science from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, graduating magna cum laude (3.83 GPA) in 2.5 years. I completed undergraduate research and presented at IBM Thomas J. Watson Laboratory.
