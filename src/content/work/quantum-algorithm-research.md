## Quantum Algorithm Research

### Quantum Optimization for Educational Resources

This research project explores the application of quantum algorithms to solve complex optimization problems in educational resource allocation. The work focuses on using quantum computing principles to improve how educational institutions distribute limited resources.

### Research Goals

- **Resource Optimization**: Develop quantum algorithms for optimal resource allocation
- **Scalability Analysis**: Study how quantum solutions scale compared to classical approaches
- **Practical Implementation**: Create proof-of-concept implementations using current quantum hardware

### Methodology

- **Quantum Algorithm Design**: QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) implementation
- **Classical Comparison**: Benchmarking against traditional optimization methods
- **Hardware Testing**: Validation on IBM Quantum systems via Qiskit

### Technologies Used

- **Quantum Framework**: Qiskit, IBM Quantum Experience
- **Classical Simulation**: NumPy, SciPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Documentation**: Jupyter Notebooks

### Preliminary Results

Initial testing shows promising quantum advantage for specific optimization problems, particularly in scenarios with high dimensional constraint spaces typical in educational planning.
