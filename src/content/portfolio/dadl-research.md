**University of Louisiana at Lafayette**

During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to conduct in-depth research on curriculum learning approaches for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a technique exploring how the order and structure in a training data affects deep learning model performance. 

This work was fueled by my broader mission to understand learning systems - not just in machines, but to better understand the parallels between machine learning human cognitive processes.

A highlight from this was being able to present my research at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Laboratory, where I not only shared my findings but also gained valuable insights from other researchers. 

This opportunity deepened my appreciation for the research process, showing me that the most elegant solutions are often grounded in simple, clear explanations rather than complexity.

Since our research focused on how a model's expectations shapes its learning, this project also ignited a deeper curiosity: We were able to make predictions based on how the model was constructed. What kinds of models are out there that can make sense of human learning systems?

**Technical Skills and Methods:**  
- Implemented CNN architectures in Python for image classification tasks  
- Applied wavelet theory and signal processing techniques for feature extraction  
- Conducted rigorous experimental design and statistical validation to ensure robust findings  
- Developed academic presentation skills through professional research dissemination
