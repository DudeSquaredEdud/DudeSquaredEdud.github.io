During my sophomore year of college, my friends and I with ADHD were struggling to keep up with traditional note-taking. Our notes were broken and unreadable after lectures, making review nearly impossible. I realized that given the topic and the notes as context, an LLM (which were at the time still extremely experimental) could transform it into actual structured notes, making review more accessible for students with attention disorders.

We built Aluminotes on Django, using Google Gemini to process and reformat the notes. The system would take in shorthand notes and output coherent lecture summaries with proper structure and context. 

We used it for a class project and refined it based on our own experiences as the target users. Being in our own user target allowed us to focus on the specific pain points we encountered daily.

Aluminotes won first place at our school's Inn-eaux-vate pitch competition. The judges recognized both the technical execution and the genuine accessibility need it addressed. More importantly, it proved to me that EdTech could directly solve real barriers to learning when designed by those who experience those barriers.
