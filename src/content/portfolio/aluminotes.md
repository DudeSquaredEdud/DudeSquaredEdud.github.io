**Overview:**  
Aluminotes is an app designed to help students with disabilities, particularly those with ADHD, by reformatting notes for easier comprehension. Our project won 1st place in the Inn-Eaux-Vate pitch competition.

**Role and Leadership:**  
I served as the tech lead and creative lead for a three-person development team. We built the app using Django, integrating a specially trained Google Gemini AI model to assist in restructuring notes. Our motivation came from personal experience - our own notes were often fragmented or difficult to read due to the speed we had to take notes down to understand the lectures.

**Technical Innovation:**  
- Streamlined the process of note re-comprehension and reshaping for clarity  
- Developed an early version of a prompt library for enhanced AI interaction  
- Focused specifically on supporting students with ADHD and learning difficulties through user testing

**Team Coordination:**  
- Initially faced challenges in coordinating tasks and avoiding overlap within the team  
- Established a custom organization system to improve collaboration  
- Learned that managing team dynamics was as crucial as overcoming technical hurdles in project success
