## 0001 First Entry: Exit
**December 10, 2024 - Tuesday**

I'm graduating soon. Like, 10 days soon. Part of me is excited. The other part of me is gonna need to adapt pretty quickly. And so I spent some time last night writing out a plan for the six months I have between now and grad school[0](#0001-fn-0).

It boils down to two things:
- Get a job.
- Research.

The job part is tricky right now; I've applied to places before. I would *imagine* I'm quite qualified for the places I apply to given my resume, but so far I have had no luck in finding work except for the DADL Lab.

The research part is easy[3](#0001-fn-3) -- I want to look at more research papers [1](#0001-Fn-1). It would be especially helpful to look at research papers once I get into grad school[0](#0001-fn-0).

### 0001 Footnotes
#### 0001 Fn 0
Fingers crossed in this economy.
#### 0001 Fn 1
I actually have a bucket list:
- Education/AI papers, from places like the iSAT lab at CU Boulder. [2](#0001-fn-2)
- Modern pedagogy papers from Harvard and other schools that study pedagogy.
- Random crap that catches my interest.

#### 0001 Fn 2
I suggest that everyone looks at [this paper](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10284384), because it prescribes a very simple way to make much more readable texts.

#### 0001 Fn 3
By comparison, of course. With how jobs are looking right now, reading and reviewing is notably easier.
