# ðŸŽ“ **PHASE 4: EDUCATIONAL FEATURES - SOLVING SEQUENCES**
**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: ðŸš€ **STARTING ADVANCED EDUCATIONAL FEATURES**  
**Focus**: Creating solving sequences to model student problem-solving steps

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **EDUCATIONAL VISION**

### **Core Goal**: Transform equation builder into a step-by-step learning tool
- **Students see**: Step-by-step solving sequences
- **Teachers create**: Custom problem-solving workflows  
- **System provides**: Interactive guidance through solution steps

### **Learning Sequence Examples**:
```
Linear Equation: 2x + 5 = 13
Step 1: 2x + 5 = 13
Step 2: 2x = 13 - 5    [Subtract 5 from both sides]
Step 3: 2x = 8         [Simplify]
Step 4: x = 8/2        [Divide both sides by 2]
Step 5: x = 4          [Solution]
```

## ðŸ“š **EQUATION LIBRARY PLAN**

### **Phase 4A: Add Comprehensive Equation Set**
1. **Linear Equations** (20+ examples)
   - Simple: `x + 3 = 7`
   - Multi-step: `2x + 5 = 13`
   - With fractions: `(x/2) + 3 = 8`
   - With variables on both sides: `3x + 2 = x + 8`

2. **Quadratic Equations** (15+ examples)
   - Standard form: `xÂ² + 5x + 6 = 0`
   - Factoring: `(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0`
   - Quadratic formula cases

3. **System of Equations** (10+ examples)
   - Substitution method
   - Elimination method
   - Graphical solutions

4. **Advanced Topics** (10+ examples)
   - Exponential equations
