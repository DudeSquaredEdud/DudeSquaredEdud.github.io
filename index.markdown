It is a French name; the exact origin is disputed.

I was always told that it was the name of a horse thief -- his name was originally "Pierre Andre Pont," his middle and last name being fused in an attempt to thwart anyone from France trying to look for him after he fled to the United States.

[*Buuuuuuut* apparently there's a website that says that it's just a normal name from France.](https://namecensus.com/last-names/andrepont-surname-popularity/) It's wild.
